# Static Comp Solo Challenge

## Overview
This solo challenge was completed during Mod 2 at the Turing School of Software and Design. The main goal of this project was to practice creating a responsive webpage layout in HTML and CSS based on a given comp. The original comp was a desktop-sized layout, so one of the challenges was to scale the given layout down for smaller screens. This project was also a great opportunity to practice with FlexBox.
